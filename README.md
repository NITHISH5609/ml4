## Image Captioning Translator

This is a project that generates captions for an input image and then translates the caption to Kannada, Hindi and Tamil languages. The project uses a deep learning model to generate captions for the input image and a translation API to translate the generated caption into Kannada, Hindi, and Tamil languages.

## Requirements
The project requires the following libraries to be installed:

- Tensorflow + Keras
- Streamlit
- Pillow
- Google Translate API
- OpenCV

## Usage

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucifertrj/Dekh.ai.git
```
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```py
streamlit run app.py
```

- Upload an image using the "Choose an image" button.
- Click on the "Generate Caption" button to generate a caption for the uploaded image.
- Click on the "Translate to Kannada/Hindi/Tamil" from Radio button to translate the generated caption to the selected language.

## Purpose

This project serves the following three purposes:

- **Image captioning**: The project generates captions for an input image using a deep learning model. This can be used to provide descriptions for images and to make them more accessible for visually impaired individuals.

- **Language translation**: The project translates the generated captions into Kannada, Hindi, and Tamil languages using a translation API. This can be used to make the generated captions accessible to non-English speaking individuals and to reach a wider audience.

- **Deep learning application**: The project uses a deep learning model to generate captions for the input image. This can be used as an example of how deep learning can be used for image captioning and other computer vision tasks.
